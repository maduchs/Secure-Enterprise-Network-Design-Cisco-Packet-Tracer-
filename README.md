# Secure-Enterprise-Network-Design-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-

This repository contains a complete secure enterprise network design and implementation built using Cisco Packet Tracer, as well as a report covering the entire process.

The project demonstrates a professionally structured network for a **generic multi-department organisation**, featuring segmentation, secure routing, core services, and layered access controls.

The design focuses on:

- **Reliable connectivity**
- **Strong network segmentation**
- **Security-driven architecture**
- **Scalable addressing and routing**
- **Practical implementation and testing**
