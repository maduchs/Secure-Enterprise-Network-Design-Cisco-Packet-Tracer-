# Secure-Enterprise-Network-Design-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-

This project was developed as part of a **network design and security coursework assessment**.  
It demonstrates the creation of a secure, segmented enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer, supported by a full technical report detailing the design, implementation, configurations, and testing.

The repository includes both:
- The **Packet Tracer project file**
- The **complete written report** documenting all stages of the network design

The design focuses on:

- **Reliable connectivity**
- **Strong network segmentation**
- **Security-driven architecture**
- **Scalable addressing and routing**
- **Practical implementation and testing**
